Dear Mr/Mrs,
We are members of the following open source and free software communities:

* <put_your_community_here>

And as encouraged by your latest community hearing on reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/5x4hxu/we_are_amd_creators_of_athlon_radeon_and_other/
we are kindly asking you the following to release the PSP (Platform Security Processor) under libreboot and coreboot or even on public under GNU Gpl or similar licence.
We are also asking and erdosing you to further continue to support free software operating systems such and GNU\Linux and BSD variations to your all variety of products that AMD Makes.

We believe that this will have the following benefits to the company's future:

# Stratigic Marketing Lead:
The therm PC as we all know means Personal Computer, that means "A computer that is MINE", by opening the source code of PSP 
and further supporting free and open source Operating Systems as well as libreboot and coreboot you are giving the essence 
to the end user that he's the master of his computer and not the opposite.

Furthermore you are allowing to the end users to have a "pillow" of privacy on this days that end user privacy is starting to 
become less and less available.

# New Market Share:
By opening the source code of PSP and further supporting free software OS as well as libreboot and coreboot 
you are allowing a new group of consumers to buy your products this group of consumers are sonsisted of:
* Hackers, Tinkers, and hardware enthusiasts.
* Privacy aware computer users.

Hacker and tinkers are people driven by problem solving and modifying by making the PSP source code available to coreboot/libreboot
you are givint to them a new 'toy' to experiment with. Also by these people the technology has progressed and new ideas come by. 
Furtermore by opening PSP source code you are making people feel more safe nowdays that user privacy is becoming more and more rare,
and that because they know what its computer runs.

Your sincerelly,
Dimitrios Desyllas,
